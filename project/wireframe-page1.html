                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>Too often, the wonderful world of web and computer programming does not enter the cosmology of academics strongly rooted in the Humanities. It seemed that the most significant computer science debate for these colleagues is the preference for a 'Mac' or 'Windows' machine.</p>

                <p>It was during my graduate studies that I began to work with linux based operating systems without the realization that I had indeed initiated a decades long programming hobby that culminated when I submitted my Ph.D dissertation compiled using LaTex and a dated laptop running an Unbuntu OS.</p>
                <h2>Real-World Problem</h2>
                <p>The perfect text content for a project, whether it is for game, data analysis, course development, or a marketing campaign, is stored in a pdf file. In some cases, the text can be readily copied into another file format. However, this often creates an extra step in a work-flows that format the text electronically. </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>To avoid from saving a pdf to a word document or relying on your ability to copy, paste, and format; I researched python data extraction. Here enter the name of the file on line 5. The extracted text will appear in the terminal. </p>

                <div class="image-container"></div>
                <p>Hover over to load image</p>

                <p>You can translate this text by using a built-in function. </p>
